## List Formatting

Lists follow pretty straightforward formatting.

```
- [**Title**](http://link-to-website.com) - [GitHub](https://gitub.com/if-applicable) - `Any` `Relevant` `Tags` - The description.

### Formatting Rules

- Use dashes to separate different segments of info.
- If something doesn't apply (GitHub link, tags, etc.) you can leave it out.
- Make titles bold to differentiate them from the GitHub links.
- Grab descriptions from GitHub repositories or homepage introductions. The shorter the better.
- Donâ€™t repeat the name of the item in the description.
- Start descriptions with a capital letter and end them with a full stop.
- Double check your speeling and well good grammar.
